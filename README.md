# calorie-tracker-ios


### Project Name: Caloria

### Overview:
Caloria is an iOS application designed to help users track their daily calorie allowance based on a specific diet plan. The app allows users to either "spend" or "save" a daily allowance of 150 free calories. Unused calories can be accumulated over time, with a maximum accumulation period of 10 days.

### Key Features:
1. **Daily Calorie Tracking**: Track the daily intake and saving of 150 free calories.
2. **Calorie Usage Entry**: Users can mark calories as used and enter details on what they were spent on.
3. **Calorie Saving Feature**: If calories are not used, they are automatically added to an accumulated balance.
4. **Accumulation Cap**: The app should cap the calorie accumulation at 10 days worth of calories (1500 calories).
5. **History View**: Display a history of daily calorie usage and savings.
6. **Data Persistence**: Store user data locally to keep track of calorie intake over time.

### Technical Specifications:
- **Platform**: iOS 15+
- **Languages**: Swift 5
- **UI Toolkit**: SwiftUI
- **Data Management**: Core Data for local data storage
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for a clean separation of concerns and better manageability.

### Data Model:
Entity: **Caloria**
Attributes:
- **date** (Date): The date for the calorie entry.
- **caloriesUsed** (Boolean): Flag to indicate if the calories were used or saved.
- **details** (String, optional): Description of what the calories were spent on (only if used).
- **accumulatedCalories** (Int): Total accumulated calories (updated only if saved).

### User Interface:
1. **Home View**:
    - **Date Display**: Shows the current date.
    - **Calorie Status Toggle**: Switch to mark calories as used or saved.
    - **Details Input Field**: Appears if calories are marked as used; users can enter what they were spent on.
    - **Accumulated Calories Display**: Shows the total accumulated calories if not used.
    - **Save Button**: To save the dayâ€™s calorie data.

2. **History View**:
    - List or calendar view of past entries.
    - Each entry shows the date, status (used/saved), and details if used.

### Development Milestones:
1. **Setup and Project Configuration**:
    - Initialize the project in Xcode with Swift and SwiftUI.
    - Enable Core Data for local storage.
    - Setup the initial project structure following MVVM principles.

2. **Core Data Model Setup**:
    - Define the Core Data entity and attributes as per the specification.
    - Generate NSManagedObject subclasses.

3. **UI Development**:
    - Develop the Home View using SwiftUI.
    - Implement the History View for tracking past calorie data.

4. **Data Integration**:
    - Integrate Core Data into SwiftUI views.
    - Implement the logic for adding, updating, and retrieving calorie data.

5. **Testing**:
    - Perform unit tests to ensure the business logic is correct.
    - UI tests to ensure the app behaves as expected across different devices.

6. **Deployment Preparation**:
    - Ensure all assets comply with Appleâ€™s guidelines.
    - Prepare metadata and screenshots for submission to the App Store.

7. **Launch**:
    - Submit the app for review.
    - Address any feedback from Apple and prepare for launch.

### Best Practices:
- **Code Quality**: Ensure the code is clean, well-commented, and adheres to current Swift best practices.
- **Security**: Implement appropriate data handling and storage practices to ensure user privacy.
- **Accessibility**: Make the app accessible to a broad audience, including support for dynamic text sizes and VoiceOver.
- **Localization**: Prepare the appâ€™s interface to be localized into multiple languages in the future if needed.

### Documentation:
Provide detailed documentation on the project structure, data model, and any third-party libraries used. Include setup instructions and a comprehensive guide on how the app operates.
